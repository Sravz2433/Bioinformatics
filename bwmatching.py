Implement BWMatching.
     Input: A string BWT(Text), followed by a collection of Patterns.
     Output: A list of integers, where the i-th integer corresponds to the number of substring matches of the i-th member of Patterns
     in Text.

Sample Input:
TCCTCTATGAGATCCTATTCTATGAAACCTTCA$GACCAAAATTCTCCGGC
CCT CAC GAG CAG ATC
Sample Output:
2 1 1 0 1

Pseudocode:
    BetterBWMatching(FirstOccurrence, LastColumn, Pattern, Count)
